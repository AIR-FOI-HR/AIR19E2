# BlaBlaEat

BlaBlaEat is an app which will permit you to share lunch, dinner or even breakfast with your friends or just with random people. It's good oportunity to meet people and get new friends ;)

### Technologies
During this project we first wanted to discorver new technologies, that's why we decides to use the framwork [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) developed by [Facebook](https://facebook.com). This technologies enables web developers to create robust mobile applications using their existing JavaScript knowledge. It offers faster mobile development, and more efficient code sharing across iOS, Android, and the Web, without sacrificing the end userâ€™s experience or application quality.

As for the database, we use [Google's Firebase Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/) due to it comprehensive documentation and ease of implementation. The team is going to use [GitHub](https://github.com) as platform to manage the version control of the application (the repository we are using can be accessed through this link); and [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com) to manage our project planning (the board can be found through this link)

### Project Planning
Our team is following Scrum framework during the development process. As said before, we are monitoring our progress using tool [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com) where we can submit issues, set milestones, review closed issues. We planned to finish our project in three sprints, and using a fourth sprint to correct bugs, and finish tasks that we couldn't finished during the last sprints.
